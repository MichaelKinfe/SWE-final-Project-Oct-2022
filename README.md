Problem Description 
 

Assuming we have been hired by a Fontana Car Rental to design a car rental app that consists of all car rents available. The car rental so far has been operating by call and in person reservation but now we want to upgrade to an online rental service. Car Rentals that allow customers to rent cars online, pick and return to our physical location, this way you do not have to go to the physical location/store before making a reservation or car rentage. 
 

Generally, The Requirements For our Rental are:

The Search for car rent can be done by Car Model, Price, brand, by Usage.
We want a record of the information about our customers phone number, address, Gmail, and car license information.
We want to add the rules and regulations regarding Fontana Car Rentals.
Customers can register on the system and make reservations.
Customer must have a valid driver’s license.
Employee can search customer by Id, Name, Gmail, and license number.Employee can keep track of all our cars currently rented and not rented.
Employee can manage customer information and status. 
Each rental car has a pickup date and return date.Customer can rent only one car at a time.
Customers should put a review of the service and experiences they had with our car rental so that we can analyze our services for improvement. 
It is possible to extend the return date of the rented car for additional fee.
